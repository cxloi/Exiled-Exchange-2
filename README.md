<b>== THIS IS A FORK FOR MY OWN GAMING NEEDS ==</b> 

## 1. Price Track Widget
Create a new price track widget to always show price based on available currency data.

1. add price track widget
![Price Track Widget](./renderer/public/images/priceTrack-widget.png)
2. edit entry, the search input will filter each drop options, select to track it, filter support both translated text or key(english)
![Price Track Search](./renderer/public/images/priceTrack-search.png)
3. reuse vue component ItemQuickPrice to display pricing
![Price Track Result](./renderer/public/images/priceTrack-result.png)

## 2. Item Trade List
A simple modification on existing StashSearch widget
- add a new prefix logic to turn StashSearch button to open trade site based on name starts with #, become a hyperlink
- append current league.id as uri component
- entry without # is not affected

1. find trade filter codes
![Extract Trade Code](./renderer/public/images/tradeSite-code.png)
2. configure using stash search panel
![Configure Hashtag Link](./renderer/public/images/hashTag-link.png)
3. build trade list
![Build Equip List](./renderer/public/images/buildEquip-list.png)

## 3. Expedition Price Check
Its modified from Endre's [fork](https://github.com/Endre-Tonnessen/Exiled-Exchange-2-Expedition-Checker) project, thanks to his implementation on Windows's OCR. Support zh-Hans translation in expedition widget.

### Mac Port
1. added mac port of OCR, using macOS native engine, currently set to ocr zh-Hans,en-US at the same time
![Ocr Mac Port](./renderer/public/images/expedition-macPort.png)
2. to build dmg
  - `sh testUpdate.sh`
3. grant accessibility + screen recording
  - remove the permission entries
  - re-sign `codesign --force --deep --sign - /Applications/Exiled\ Exchange\ 2.app`
  - kill the app and grant both
  - restart the app

### Win Port
1. modified win port of OCR to support zh-Hans, limitation on Windows OCR: only one language per call, no mixed zh+en pass, so the lang is pass from app language config
![Ocr Win Port](./renderer/public/images/expedition-winPort.png)
2. install extra language OCR
  - open powershell with admin rights
  - `Add-WindowsCapability -Online -Name "Language.OCR~~~zh-TW~0.0.1.0"` and restart
  - configure ExiledExchange2 language, support zh-Hans,en-US mapping
3. to build exe
  - run build instruction from [DEVELOPING.md](./DEVELOPING.md#how-to-build)
  - open powershell with admin rights
  - cd to main/
  - `npx electron-builder --win --x64`

## *Below all from upstream
**This is a personal fork of [Kvan7/Exiled-Exchange-2](https://github.com/Kvan7/Exiled-Exchange-2),
customized for my own use** — notably an added Expedition Price Check widget
(see [EXPEDITION_CHECK.md](./EXPEDITION_CHECK.md)) that OCRs the Path of
Exile 2 Expedition "Runeshape Combinations" reward panel and shows a live
poe.ninja price next to each reward row, right in the game window:

**Expedition Price Check is Windows-only** - it reads the panel via Windows'
own OCR engine (`Windows.Media.Ocr`), which has no equivalent on other
platforms. The rest of the app (everything from upstream Exiled Exchange 2)
remains cross-platform; only this one added feature is gated to Windows.

Path of Exile 2 overlay program for price checking items, among many other loved features - forked from [Awakened PoE Trade](https://github.com/SnosMe/awakened-poe-trade).

This fork isn't the official project or distributed anywhere - build it from source (see Development, below). For the actual Exiled Exchange 2 app, the only official sources are <https://kvan7.github.io/Exiled-Exchange-2/download> or <https://github.com/Kvan7/Exiled-Exchange-2/releases>; anywhere else may be malicious.

## Setting up Expedition Price Check

1. In the overlay's widget bar, open the **⋯** menu → **Add widget...** → **Expedition Price Check**.

   ![Add widget menu](./docs/reference-images/ExpeditionSetupStep1.png)

2. Hover the new widget and click **Edit**.

   ![Edit the widget](./docs/reference-images/ExpeditionSetupStep2.png)

3. Drag the green box over the reward text column of the "Runeshape Combinations"
   panel (the default position won't match your resolution/UI scale), confirm or
   change the hotkey (defaults to `Shift + M`), then click **Save**.

   ![Calibrate region, set hotkey, save](./docs/reference-images/ExpeditionSetupStep3.png)

4. In-game, open a Runeshape Combinations panel and press the hotkey - a price should appear next to each recognized row.

### Expedition Price Check settings

All of the following live in the widget's own settings panel (**Edit**, per
step 2 above).

| Setting | Default | What it does |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Hotkey | `Shift + M` | Triggers a single scan of the calibrated region. |
| Region (drag the green box, or type exact x/y/width/height fractions) | calibrated per-user | The area that gets OCR'd on each scan - see step 3 above. |
| Color-code prices by rank | On | Colors each resolved price by how it ranks against the *other rows currently on screen* - highest is green, lowest is red, anything in between is yellow. This is relative to the current panel, not a fixed currency cutoff, so it keeps meaning the same thing as prices drift over a league. Example from the first screenshot above: rewards worth 4.2/4.4/8.4/1.2/12 exalted show 12 green, 1.2 red, and the other three yellow. A single resolved row (or every row tied at the same value) shows green. |
| Show full names (uncapped width) | On | Lets the widget grow wide enough to show the full recognized name instead of truncating it, so a misread is easy to spot. Turn off for a more compact widget once you trust the matches and don't need to see the name day-to-day. |
| Show raw OCR text (debug) | Off | Prints every unprocessed recognized line below the parsed rows - for diagnosing a new/changed panel layout or a matching problem without needing to instrument any code. |

<!-- ## Moving from POE1/Awakened PoE Trade

1. Download latest release from [releases](https://github.com/Kvan7/exiled-exchange-2/releases)
2. Run installer
3. Run Exiled Exchange 2
4. Launch PoE2 to generate correct files
5. Quit PoE2 and EE2 after seeing the banner popup that EE2 loaded
6. Copy `apt-data` from `%APPDATA%\awakened-poe-trade` to `%APPDATA%\exiled-exchange-2` to copy your previous settings
  - Resulting directory structure should look like this:
  - `%APPDATA%\exiled-exchange-2\apt-data\`
    - `config.json`
7. Edit `config.json` and change the value of "windowTitle": "Path of Exile" to instead be "Path of Exile 2", otherwise it will open only for poe1
8. Start Exiled Exchange 2 and PoE2 -->

### Development

Two parts, run in two separate shells (both need to stay running):

```shell
# Shell 1, from the repo root
cd renderer
npm ci
npm run make-index-files
npm run dev
```

```shell
# Shell 2, from the repo root
cd main
npm ci
npm run dev
```

The `main` process launches the actual Electron app window once it's built - the
`renderer` dev server needs to already be running first, since `main` loads the UI
from it (`http://localhost:5173`) rather than from built files in this mode. Editing
`renderer/` hot-reloads; editing `main/` rebuilds and restarts the Electron process
automatically (which resets any in-memory app state, e.g. unsaved widget config).

See [DEVELOPING.md](./DEVELOPING.md) for formatting, production builds, and releasing.

### Installing dependencies safely

Use `npm ci`, not `npm install`, for routine setup - it installs exactly what
`package-lock.json` already resolved (same versions, same integrity hashes) and
errors out instead of silently re-resolving anything if the lockfile and
`package.json` disagree. Plain `npm install` can still pick up a newer version
within an existing `^`/`~` range in some cases; `npm ci` never does.

Given how often popular packages get compromised via a hijacked maintainer
account (a malicious version published under a trusted name, still semver-valid
so ordinary installs happily accept it), a few more habits are worth keeping:

- **Never run `npm update` or `npm install <pkg>@latest` casually.** Only bump a
  version deliberately, and review the full `package-lock.json` diff afterward -
  a small, intentional bump should produce a small diff; a huge, unexplained
  churn of unrelated transitive dependencies is worth stopping to look at before
  committing (this happened once already in this fork's history from a stray
  `npm install`, caught and reverted before it was committed).
- **Always commit `package-lock.json`, and read its diff like code.** It's the
  thing that actually pins what gets installed - treat an unexpected change to
  it with the same suspicion as an unexpected change to a source file.
- **Consider `--ignore-scripts`** (`npm ci --ignore-scripts`, or `ignore-scripts=true`
  in `.npmrc`) to block install-time lifecycle scripts, which is the actual
  mechanism most recent supply-chain payloads run through. Caveat: some
  dependencies legitimately need their install script to work at all - Electron
  itself downloads its platform binary via one, and native modules like
  `uiohook-napi` compile via one - so this isn't a safe blanket default here
  without testing that `main/` still installs correctly with it on.
- **`npm audit`** catches *known, already-reported* vulnerabilities in your
  current tree - useful, but reactive. It won't catch a malicious version in the
  window between publication and discovery, so it's a supplement to the habits
  above, not a replacement for them.
